0.9.8
-----
- Bug fix on the following (Adam Kiezun):
    // Java 5.0
	class I{
	  Set foo(){ //open callee hierarchy
	     return new HashSet(){
	        public boolean add(Object o) {
	          return super.add(o);
	        }
	     };
	  }
	} 
	Actually appears to be a call hierarchy bug (do a caller
	tree from HashSet() and the constructor method appears), 
	but I added code to support IType in the tree view now, 
	too.


0.9.7 - 7/27/05
-----
Big update, mostly on the inside, though this plug-in now works back 
on 3.0 as well.

- Finding the Call Hierarchy Tree is better, not dependent on node text
  but on the instanceof the root item's data.
- Now using IMember instances from TreeItems to get text for graph nodes 
  instead of parsing the TreeItem's text itself, which wasn't very stable.
  The following nodes wouldn't work previously but are fixed now:
  - generics (seems to work now -- need Adam Kiezun to try this again)
  - anonymous inner classes (maybe less than ideal output, though)
  - field initialization


0.9.6 - 7/22/05
-----
- Multi-select remove siblings removes all selected ones but first -- should retain
  all selected ones -- fixed.
- Isolate Path To Node disabled for multi-selection (but has an odd quirk in that
  it won't disable right away, but does after first attempt, or somesuch. Posted
  query to eclipse.platform newsgroup, see what comes of that -- if the menu's
  not disabled, Eclipse still kicks in the selectionChanged at that point, disables
  the action and then informs the user with a dialog box).
- went through a made everything public, except for some fields, and put getters
  on them. It's frustrating trying to tie-in my plug-in to stuff I can't get at,
  but I'd rather try to be as open as possible for any other plug-ins, etc.

=============================
Version 0.9.5 - July 21, 2005
=============================
- Core remove node code is now done properly, no resource leaks, no
  side-effect bugs.
- Fix Graph in callee mode
- "Remove Node(s)" text changed to "Remove Node"

=============================
Version 0.9.4 - July 20, 2005
=============================
- Added some rough hacks** for manipulating nodes in the tree:
  - Remove selected node(s)
  - Remove sibling nodes
  - Isolate path to node

  ** leaking resources probably
  
- New graphing feature
  - Merge with previous graph
  
- Misc code clean-up

=============================
Version 0.9.3 - July 13, 2005
=============================
- If nothing is selected, graph the whole tree. New unit test for this.
- plugin.xml fix -- moving files to different CVS module seemed to have 
  blanked the plugin.xml -- so it wouldn't hook into anything
- old unit tests back in place, compiling ... two failing because of a Device
  problem trying to create an Image. May just drop the tests.

- feature has an update URL in it now, so hopefully should be able to just
  scan for updates from now on to get them.

=============================
Version 0.9.2 - July 12, 2005
=============================
- Superficial code changes, feature and update site tweaks.

=============================
Version 0.9.1 - July 11, 2005
=============================
- This version now works from the tree view again, like the original
  hack, so no weird issues with expanded or unloaded nodes.
- Fix if any of the Trees cycled through do not have any items.
  
============================
Version 0.9.0 - July 8, 2005
============================
- Initial release.
- Basic graphing option is working, but crufty. 
- Does not respond to nodes that get collapsed, will still render them. 
- Does not render graph when selecting a previously unexpanded node.
- Could have other problems. Mostly this release is about getting
  an end-to-end connection, focusing on plug-in building and deployment
  issues.
