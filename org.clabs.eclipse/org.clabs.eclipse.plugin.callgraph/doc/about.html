<h1>cLabs Call Hierarchy Graph Eclipse JDT Hack</h1>
This hack of the org.eclipse.jdt.ui_3.0.0 plug-in adds two menu items
to the Call Hierarchy popup menu that will render the current call
hierarchy tree using <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a>
dot. <br>
<br>
Hopefully, I'll not need to resort to hacking the jdt.ui plug-in for
much longer if my lack of Eclipse know-how can be brought up to speed
quickly on how to do this as a pure, separate plug-in.<br>
<h3>Download</h3>
Go grab the current .zip in <a href="http://clabs.org/jdt">http://clabs.org/jdt</a>.
Complete source code is included in an embedded .zip file, contributed
source by cLabs is covered under the same licensing stuff as Eclipse.<br>
<h3>Installation</h3>
Close Eclipse, unzip the file in your eclipse folder, overwriting the
current org.eclipse.jdt.ui_3.0.0 plug-in. <br>
<br>
Install GraphViz dot on your system and make sure the dot executable is
in your system path, such that Eclipse can get to it. <br>
<h3>Usage</h3>
Get a Call Hierarchy going, right-click on the root node you want
graphed and choose "Show Graph". If you just want the dot source copied
to your clipboard, choose that menu item (that menu item will probably
be moved to the Show Graph shell window in the near future).<br>

jdt.clabs.3.0.0.5.zip - July 15, 2004<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<ul>
  <li>Background color of Show Graph shell window matches the image
background color now, and window sizes to match the image (limited by
the current display's bounds).</li>
  <li>Whoops, remmed out a key line in copying source to the clipboard
during a refactoring that kept it from actually doing something
resembling anything -- fixed.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

large images. Thanks to Christian Hauser on the eclipse.platform.swt
