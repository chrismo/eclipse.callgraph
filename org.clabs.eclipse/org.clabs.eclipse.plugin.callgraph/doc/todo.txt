	source, save image options, maybe.
	

1.0 Release

Future Releases
---------------
- LR/TB option toggle

- Unit tests up-to-date and running
- Close off/delete unused code
- Better error handling/UI

- Icon for graph window?

- Configurable dot.exe location (path variable?)
- Configurable graphing options? Font, etc?
- Interactive graph?
  [can get either the -Tdot or -Tgraph(?) to give you coordinates, that
   could allow interactive without internalizing the rendering]

- move menu up to the show group or whatever it's named
  [hmm, tried .../group.show and .../group.focus, but always
   failed as an invalid menu path. Double-checked the example
   in the menu path stuffs, and it looks like I found the right
   strings to use for all of this ... not sure why it's failing?
   Maybe because some of this stuff is internal and not public?]
