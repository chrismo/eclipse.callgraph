      The Call Graph Plug-in renders the current Call Hierarchy tree
view as a directed graph using GraphViz dot program (which must
be installed separately).

Also adds three varying options of removing nodes from the tree
view to help focus what will appear in the graph.

Supports Eclipse 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4
